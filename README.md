## Interesting Article: [Announcing SvelteKit 1.0](https://svelte.dev/blog/announcing-sveltekit-1.0)

[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is a meta framework for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a UI framework similar to [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). The main difference between Svelte and React is writing Svelte takes significantly less lines of code and boilerplate. Furthermore, Svelte has built-in functionality for global state management (no more [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)!) and transitions. Svelte also does not utilize a virtual DOM, instead, Svelte is simply a compiler that converts your files into something the browser can understand. This results in a magnitude smaller bundle size compared to React and better performance all around. To see a comparison between writing Svelte and React code take a look at [this site](https://component-party.dev/).

SvelteKit is to Svelte as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is to React. SvelteKit has been in beta for a couple years now and all Svelters have been looking forward to its release. Furthermore, the creator of Svelte has been asked to work at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (also owners of Next.js) full-time on Svelte, which really allowed SvelteKit to develop into the amazing framework it is today. SvelteKit hitting 1.0 and being under Vercel means it now has a strong backing, will get first-class support for many popular frameworks and libraries ([Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) are already working on Svelte/SvelteKit support), and also means more jobs will consider using SvelteKit in production. As a lover and user of Svelte/SvelteKit for the past year, I'm super excited for the framework hitting 1.0 and can't wait to use it more!
